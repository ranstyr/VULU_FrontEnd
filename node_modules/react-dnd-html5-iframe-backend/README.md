# React DnD HTML5 IFrame Backend

This is a temporary solution for making React DnD HTML5 Backend work inside an iframe.
This is done by listening for drag/drop events on `window.frames[0]`` instead of `window`.

See the [original package](https://github.com/ilyagelman/react-dnd-html5-backend)

## Installation

```
npm install --save react-dnd-html5-iframe-backend
```
